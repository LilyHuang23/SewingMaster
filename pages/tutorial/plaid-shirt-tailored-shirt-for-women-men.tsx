                <List type={ListType.disc}>
                    <li>professional cutting influences a professional garment</li>
                    <li>have good shears, cut with nice, long strokes--do not use rotary cutter</li>
                    <li>be alert and awake </li>
                    <li>save all your scraps</li>
                    <li>cut out a single layer at a time</li>
                    <li>choose a dominant line and use that same line for your center back, center yoke, and front band</li>
                    <li>mark all right side pieces of cut fabric with a piece of tape</li>
                    <li>do not use flannel--it creeps</li>
                    <li>match everything horizontally and vertically when possible</li>

                    Check entire plaid fabric on both sides to look for flaws.  If there are flaws, identify them with masking tape.  That way you can cut around these areas.                </Text>

                <Text>Also identify the top of your fabric on the right side with an arrow.  This will keep all your pattern pieces going the same direction.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Lay out your fabric single layer right side up.  Double check that the horizontal and vertical plaid lines are perpendicular to each other.  It is helpful to lay out the fabric on a cloth table.  This grips the fabric so that it will not slip around. With a long ruler, check the horizontal plaid lines to make sure they are straight and perpendicular to the vertical lines.  You want the fabric to be absolutely straight.  You may also use a square ruler to see that your vertical and horizontal lines are 90 degrees square.  Only prepare the fabric area for the current pattern you plan to cut out.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Choose the dominant line that you would like to have for center back, center yoke, and button band.  This particular plaid is uneven.  I have chosen to go between the thin blue vertical lines.  The pin indicates where the center is between the two blue lines.</Text>
                <Text subtitle className="mt-10">CUTTING OUT--BACK, YOKE, and CENTER FRONT--MUST DO IN THIS ORDER</Text>
                <Text p>With fabric right side up, mark center of dominant line and place back pattern right side up, with fold line on the center of the dominant line.  At least in three places, check the horizontal lines on both edges of the pattern to make sure these lines are perpendicular to the vertical lines.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Cut out the back piece, but do not cut on the center back fold line.  You may want to put objects on the center back line so that you do not accidentally cut there.</Text>

                <Text p>Identify the center of the dominant plaid you have chosen.  Since this yoke pattern piece is a full pattern, I have folded it in half.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Place yoke pattern right side up on lengthwise grain, with center back matching the center of the dominant plaid line.  </Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />

                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Cut out the first side of the yoke.  Since the bottom of the yoke is a straight edge, cut along the bottom straight edge on a plaid line or precisely parallel to a plaid line.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Then fold yoke in half at center back, right on dominant plaid line.  Match up horizontal and vertical plaid lines and pin in place.  Cut out rest of yoke.  You will cut out the yoke lining later.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Get plaid fabric on grain again, right side up.  Place front pattern piece right side up.  Start by lining up the front vertical line.  DO NOT PIN IN PLACE YET.  You still need to match the side seam with the back piece and the shoulder with the yoke piece.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>To match both vertical and horizontal plaid lines, place the cut back piece on top of the front pattern, with side seams lining up. </Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Then place the yoke above, matching the shoulder seam with the front pattern.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Then move front shirt pattern so that the horizontal lines will match at the side seams.  Also check to make sure that the vertical seams match at the shoulder of the yoke.  Also make sure that the front vertical edge is parallel with a vertical plaid line.  </Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>The shoulder and side seam need to match the plaid lines accurately.  Do not worry about matching the hem edge.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Because my plaid fabric is uneven, not every vertical line will match.  Notice that the outside thin blue lines match at the shoulder.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Also make sure that the front vertical edge is parallel with a vertical plaid line.  </Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Peel back the yoke and back pieces so that you can see the front pattern piece.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Cut out shirt front.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Remove all pattern pieces.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Now flip shirt front pattern right side down and match up horizontal and vertical lines to cut out the second shirt front.  Pin in place.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Notice once again that because this is an uneven plaid, not all the vertical lines match each other.  Cut out second front shirt.  This will give you a right front and a left front.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Matching horizontally at the side seam.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Now it is time to cut out the front button band.  You want to make sure that the center of the button band is the dominant vertical plaid line, or choose another dominant line.  I have chosen the center of the wide white stripe. The button band will be 2 1/4" wide.  Begin by marking the dominant vertical plaid line.  Then measure 1 1/8" out from that center mark on both sides and mark.  This will be the width of your 2 1/4" wide button band.  The band will need to match the horizontal plaid lines with the shirt front.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Once again, check to make sure that the horizontal lines of the button band will match the horizontal lines of the shirt front.  As you cut out the button band, make it an inch longer at the top and bottom.</Text>
                <Image src="#" alt="Finished Plaid Shirt" caption="PLAID SHIRT FOR WOMEN/MEN" size={ImageSize.SMALL} className="mb-5" />
                <Text p>Here is a picture of the centered button band, matching up to the shirt front.</Text>

                <Text p>Some shirt patterns have only one collar pattern and you will cut out two.  My pattern has both an upper collar and an under collar so I will cut one of each.  Notice that the under collar is slightly smaller than the upper collar.</Text>

                <Text p>You want the center back of the collar and collar stand to match the same dominant plaid line as the shirt and yoke center back.  You will cut out the upper collar and outside stand first.  Place your fabric right side up and get it on grain.

                </Text>
                <Text p>The larger point of the collar point is towards the bottom, so that the collar is placed the same direction as the shirt.  Notice I labeled my collar patterns "TOP" with an arrow towards the top of the fabric.  This is especially important when you have an uneven plaid.
                </Text>
                <Text p>Line up the center fold on the center of the dominant plaid line.  Pin in place and make sure that the horizontal and vertical lines are perpendicular to each other.</Text>

                <Text p>Cut out interfacing for upper collar and outside stand.  I am using this medium weight interfacing.  It is so light that I do not need to trim off some of the seam allowance.</Text>

                <Text p>Sew collars together with 1/4" seam allowance.  When you get to 1/2" from corner point, change stitch length to 1.5.  Continue stitching to almost the corner marking.  With needle in down position, raise presser foot and turn fabric diagonally.  Stitch two tiny stitches diagonally.  Then turn fabric again and continue stitching.  After 1/2" out from the first corner, return stitch length to normal.  Continue stitching to opposite collar corner and repeat process.

                <Text p>The following method is taken from the "Shirtmaking" book by David Coffin.  It is a great technique to prevent bulk at the front of the collar stand.

                </Text><Text p>For clarification, we will call the interfaced collar stand the OUTSIDE STAND and the collar stand facing the INSIDE STAND.

                </Text><Text p>With shirt right side up, pin outside stand to neckline, matching center back and front markings.

                </Text><Text p>The stand should extend beyond the shirt 1/4" for this pattern.  (5/8" for 5/8" seam allowance pattern.)</Text>

                <Text p>Wrap the collar and collar stand around a tailors ham and pin in place.  Press collar and let fabric cool.  This will help the collar start to have a "memory" so that is will curve around the neck.  When storing the shirt, fold the shoulders nicely so as to not disturb the collar and stand.</Text>
